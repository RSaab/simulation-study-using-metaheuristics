# Overview 
GA algorithm implentation in Golang. Adapted to a layout simulation study problem for a coffee shop. the algorithm will provide an optimal layout maximising budget based on linear regression model developed using simulated data. The simulation model is built using Arena.

# How to Run
Run the makefile using the `make` command

Run the compiled binary from the terminal to run the algorithm
